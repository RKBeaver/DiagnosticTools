This repsonitory contains a selection of the Python scipts and functions I've developed for processing data from primarily a PicoScope oscilliscope and Diasys (an Engine interface software)

Incylinder Pressure Comparator:
    This script takes a 2 channel recording (Channel A = Incylinder Pressure, Channel B = Flywheel tooth pickup signal) of a pressure recording from within the cylinder of a Natural Gas spark ignition engine. 
    
    The scipt converts the recording from the time domain to the angle (Crankangle) domain and attempts to highlight potential issues with lack of compression, air charge mass loss and valve timing.
