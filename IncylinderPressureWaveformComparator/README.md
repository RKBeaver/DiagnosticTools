The Matlab file is generated by PicoScope 6 or 7 from a 2 channel recording. 

The PicoScope setting file is included within the git with the standard recording settings I use.  
Depending on cranking speed the timedomain might need to be adjusted. 

Channel A = Incylinder Pressure Sensor
Channel B = Crankshaft Flywheel Pickup Signal. 

The number of crankteeth is defined in the first section of the script. 
The script will not work with a n+1 tooth arrangement, ie the crankshaft pickup signal must not contain a missing tooth.
